# InternshipIII-ACRI
***
- Work realised in the summer of 2021 with the ACRI (Atlantic Cancer Research Institute).
  - Performed tests on beef liver while being submitted to high powered micro-waves. The parameters being measured were S parameters. 
  - Five machines were combined together (Network Analyzer, Microwave Generator, Switch, Peristaltic Pump, Isocratic Pump).
- The final version of the code is available in the folder *CodeFinal/CircuitAutomatisation_V5_2021*.
  -As of now, the code cannot be run locally for tests. **Will be changed in the near future**.
- The folder 2ports is able to control two ports simultaneously on the network analyzer.
